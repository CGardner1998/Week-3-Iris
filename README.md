# Week 3 Iris 

## Overview
Week 3 Iris project uses the Iris dataset to find iris species using the Random Forest classifier.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset had samples of iris flowers, each with 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify the samples into one of three species.

## Model
A RandomForest classifier was used to build the model. 

## Key Insights
-The model is good at telling the three species apart. Looking at the details, I found that the size of the petals is the most important aspect of this project.
